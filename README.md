# Astro Wanderer

A personal site theme for [Astro](https://astro.build) — portfolio, blog, and travel photo galleries in one quiet, fast template.

**[Live demo](https://igagansingh.com/astro-wanderer)**

## Why Wanderer

Most developer portfolios stop at the work page. Wanderer is built around the idea that a good personal site shows what you're like *when you're not working* — so it ships with a travel section where every trip is a story with a photo carousel and lightbox, right next to your résumé and blog.

## Features

- **Home** — hero with a typing animation, avatar, and social links
- **Work** — expandable experience timeline, education, and skill groups, all from one data file
- **Blog** — markdown posts with tags, tag pages, prev/next navigation, reading time, and drafts
- **Travel** — trip entries with hero images, highlight badges, photo carousel, lightbox with keyboard navigation, and optional video support
- **Zero JS by default** — only three tiny scripts (theme toggle, typing effect, gallery); no framework runtime
- **Dark/light mode** — respects `prefers-color-scheme`, remembers your choice, no flash on load
- **SEO ready** — canonical URLs, Open Graph/Twitter cards, JSON-LD structured data, sitemap, RSS feed
- **Accessible** — semantic HTML, skip-free keyboard navigation in galleries, `aria` labels throughout
- **One config file** — name, socials, bio, and résumé all live in plain TypeScript data files
- **100/100 Lighthouse** out of the box on a static build

## Quick start

Use this template with the Astro CLI:

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template igagansingh/astro-wanderer
```

Or clone it directly:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/igagansingh/astro-wanderer.git
cd astro-wanderer
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `src/data/site.ts` — it's the single source of truth for your name, tagline, social links, and production URL. The sample post in `src/content/blog/getting-started.md` walks through everything else.

```

## Writing content

### Blog post

Create a markdown file in `src/content/blog/`:

```md
---
title: My first post
subtitle: An optional subtitle
date: 2026-01-15
tags: [notes]
category: tech        # or life
description: One-liner for cards and SEO.
draft: false          # true hides the post from builds
---

Your words here.
```

### Trip entry

Create a markdown file in `src/content/trips/`, drop photos into `public/img/trips/<trip>/`, and list them:

```md
---
title: Kyoto, 2026
place: Kyoto, Japan
date: 2026-04-10
summary: One line for the card.
heroImage: /img/trips/kyoto/hero.jpg
circlePhotos:                 # photos for the rotating ring
  - /img/trips/kyoto/torii.jpg
gallery:
  - /img/trips/kyoto/hero.jpg
highlights:
  - Fushimi Inari at sunrise
---

Story body here.
```

Photos in `gallery` get a carousel with a click-to-open lightbox, thumbnail strip, fullscreen mode, and arrow-key navigation. `.mp4`/`.webm` files are supported alongside images.

## Customization checklist

1. `src/data/site.ts` — name, description, URL, socials
2. `src/data/resume.ts` — roles, education, skills, hero typing words
3. `public/img/avatar.svg` → your photo · `public/img/og.jpg` → a 1200×630 share card
4. `astro.config.mjs` — set `site` to your production URL, and set (or remove) `base`
5. Write real content, then delete the two sample posts and sample trip

## Deploy

The included `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds and deploys to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`. In your repo settings, set **Settings → Pages → Source** to **GitHub Actions**.

### Hosting at a subpath (e.g. `username.github.io/my-repo`)

Keep `base: '/my-repo'` in `astro.config.mjs`. All internal links and assets are routed through a single `withBase()` helper, so everything just works. The deploy workflow automatically nests the build output under your base path so GitHub Pages resolves it. This is how the [live demo](https://igagansingh.com/astro-wanderer) is hosted.

### Hosting at the domain root (`example.com`)

Remove the `base` line from `astro.config.mjs`. The workflow detects this and ships the output un-nested.

Any static host works too — Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages — just point the build command at `npm run build` with output `dist/`.

## Commands

| Command           | Action                                    |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`     | Start local dev server                    |
| `npm run build`   | Production build to `./dist/`             |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build locally      |
| `npm run check`   | Type-check the project                    |
